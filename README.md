# Cross-Console script
Sometimes you just need to control the console. This script provides you with a way to control and take advantage of your console for what it was meant to do (log stuff). Leave the debugging to your breakpoints, start logging your code!

# Features
 - attempts to implement console in all environments, or extends the console available.
 - can have console behave differently in `development` versus `production`
 - ability to send console.error to another Function while in production (for easier error management like sending an email)
 - using localStorage, a history is kept of all previous logs, limited to 100 ( configurable )
 - add a filter so that you only see the logs you want ( will persist accross refresh in a browser )

# Install

## Via bower
```
$> bower install cross-console 
```

## Via NPM
```
$> npm install cross-console
```

## Download Manually

* Download the files using the GitHub .zip download option
* Use either the compressed `bin/cross-console.min.js` or the `lib/cross-console.js` file.

## Add a script path in your source
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="/bin/cross-console.min.js"></script>
```

# Accessing the original console
Some consoles give useful information like timing and memory usage; so you still have access to that

# Settings
To change from the default settings, just access the code via the window or root object. Notice that `cconsole` and `console` are interchangeable
```js
window.cconsole.settings || window.console.settings
```

You can also change the settings by accessing the `set` function and passing an object of key:value pairs of the following.
```js
window.console.set({
	"environment": "production",
	"debug": false,
	"notify":function(msg,identifier) {
		alert(msg,identifier);
	}
});
```

## `window.cconsole.settings.standBy`
>default `false` ( boolean )

Stand By will effectively turn off CConsole. It will act as if it was not even there.

## `window.cconsole.settings.debug`
>default `false` ( boolean )

Debug turns on all logs so that the console will light up with everything that is thrown at it.

## `window.cconsole.settings.environment`
>default `production` ( string: `development` || `production` )

This is the smartest addition to the code. Effectively, you can be in 'development' mode to be able to see all `console.error` and `console.warn` come through. If you are in `production` mode you will not see anything. If debug is on, it will overwrite this setting and allow everything to come through.

## `window.cconsole.settings.notify`
>default `function(error, identifier) { return; }` ( function )

You can overwrite this functionality in your own code. This function will be called for every `console.error` that occurs. This allows you to have a second set of loggin occur on that error, like a server backend to track them or graph them, etc.

 - error : this is the string that was given to console.error
 - identifier : this is intended to be a line item that is unique to this error, to make for easier debugging.

## `window.cconsole.settings.filter`
>default `false` ( string )

Allows the code to only show things in the console log that fit the filter that's applied. Use the `console.setFilter(string)` to apply a filter and `console.clearFilter()` to remove the filter.  __It will not filter out errors or warnings and will attempt to persist if localStorage and JSON are available using the key 'CC.filter'__

## `window.cconsole.settings.history`
>default `100` ( integer )

This is the length of the history that is kept. Having a large enough number for good use, and a low enough number to stop overgrowth is essential. __History will perist in localStorage if JSON and storage is available, using the key `CC.history`__

# Examples

## Basic changing of settings
```js
window.console.warn('Will not show up due to defaults');
// Change to development and debug
window.cconsole.settings.environment = 'development';
window.console.warn('Warns will show up while in development');

window.cconsole.settings.debug = true;
window.console.log('Everything will show up in console');

window.cconsole.settings.standBy = true;
window.console.log('Actually just using the log if it`s there');

// window.cconsole.settings.history //> array of all of the above, except the last console log because standBy was turned on
```

## Catching console.error in production
```js
window.cconsole.settings.notify = function(error, key) {
 mailEngineers(error, key);
};

console.error('This should not have happened'); // runs notify -> presumably sends emails to engineers
```

## Filtering out only the messages you expect to see
```js
window.cconsole.setFilter('myfeature');

console.log('somefeature','this isnt showing');
console.log('myfeature', 'this is showing');
console.warn('this will always show up, so will errors');

window.cconsole.clearFilter();
console.log('somefeature','now shows');
```
